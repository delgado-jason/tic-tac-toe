# Tic-Tac-Toe

## How The Game is Played
The game is played by 2 players. They represent either 'X' or 'O'. Whether a player is 'X' or 'O' is completely random and player 'X' is the first to go.

The first player to get three of their tokens in a row, column, or diagnoly wins. This game is considered futile, because two experienced players will almost always result in a draw.

## The Goal
The goal of this project is to use vanilla Javascript to build the game. More specifically, use **factory functiions** and **IIFE's (Immediately-invoked Function Expressions)**.
